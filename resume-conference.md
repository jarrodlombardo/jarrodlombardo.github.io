Robin McConnell\
President - Board of Directors\
Vancouver Comic Arts Association

Dear Robin,

With my record of effectively managing teams at 43 conventions over the past 11 years, I am eager to join VanCAA as your next Festival Director. I hope to leverage my convention and management abilities to more broadly contribute to the comics community.

Please review some highlights of my convention and community service:

* Over my 17 years of continuous service at the [Nan Desu Kan](http://ndkdenver.org) anime convention, I grew and adapted many skills as the convention expanded. Throughout the year, I regularly consult with the Board of Directors and other Department Heads to anticipate issues that may arise as we execute the plans we are designing. Work with the Directors has included program scheduling, arranging Special Guest flights, purchasing event supplies, and designing floor plans. During the event I continually consult with Logistics, Operations, Line Control, and Safety staff to ensure any gaps between their responsibilities are filled and perform high-level troubleshooting across the venue.
* During my time with the [Licton Springs PPatch Community Garden](http://lictonspringsppatch.wixsite.com/seattle), I controlled a US$160,000 grant to construct the garden and then managed our donation accounts. I provided monthly financial reports to the City of Seattle (our grantor) while maintaining the construction budget and all financial bookkeeping.
* At [Tableau Software](https://www.tableau.com/), I am part of the [Tableau Conference](https://tc18.tableau.com/) Leadership team. I am responsible for managing a workgroup of 100-250 Tableau employees from across the company to host 60-80 breakout and training rooms during the five days of our annual conference attended by up to 17,000 customers. Preparing for this role each year, I am involved in designing floor plans, signage, logistics, and access policies with a variety of other Tableau employees and event vendors. During my primary job as a Development Manager, I manage teams of developers to build and deliver complex desktop and web software by balancing the priorities of features and schedules.
* I worked closely with the PAX Chief of Staff to manage the [PAX West](http://west.paxsite.com/) and [PAX East](http://east.paxsite.com/) gaming convention staff for 14 conventions over 9 years, supervising 450-800 volunteers and staff at each convention.
* While doing all of the above, I have also volunteered at [VanCAF](http://www.vancaf.com/) four times in a variety of roles including leading the Panels team in 2017 and leading the Show Floor and Info Desk teams in 2018.

I look forward to scheduling an interview and discussing the plans for VanCAF 2019. Please email me at jarrodl@gmail.com. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,\
Jarrod Lombardo
